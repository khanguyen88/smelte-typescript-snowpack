# Svelte boilerplate project with Typescript, Smelte, Snowpack, Tailwind

> ✨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

Disclaimer: as smelte@1.1.1 doesn't support Snowpack yet, this is my own take at integrating Smelte and Snowpack. Use at 
your own risks. PRs are welcome.

CSS purging seems to work, but who knows :)

## Available Scripts

### yarn dev

Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### yarn test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about running tests for more information.

### yarn build

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder. Your app is ready to be deployed!

### yarn start

Serve the built (yarn build) version of your site at localhost:5000

### Q: What about Eject?

No eject needed! Snowpack guarantees zero lock-in, and CSA strives for the same.
